            <li> What it's about: Seo Jung-hoo (Ji Chang-wook) is a mysterious "night courier" who operates under the code name "Healer" and, with his excellent fighting skills and hacker sidekick, ensures that all of his clients' requests are completed, no matter what (so yeah, his dealings aren't usually legal).
                <br>His goal is to make enough money to buy an uninhabited island to live the rest of his life on — alone. </br><br>That changes when he's given the task of protecting Chae Young-shin (Park Min-young), a reporter from a second-rate tabloid news website who has a dark past.</br>
                This drama truly combines the best of thriller and romance!</li>

                <br>From there, the duo's lives are intertwined on an incredible journey that overcomes natural disasters, war, and just about everything in between.</br>
                Also, for K-pop fans, Shinee's Onew is part of the cast!</li>
            <li> Where to watch: Hulu or Viki</li>
        </ul></div>

        <li style="font-size:3em"><span style="font-size: .5em">Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (2017)</span></li>
        <div><a href="https://www.viki.com/tv/31706c-guardian-the-lonely-and-great-god?locale=en"><img width="250px" height="250px" src="gurdian.jfif"> </a></div>
        <div><ul>
            <li>Starring: Gong Yoo, Kim Go-eun, Lee Dong-wook</li>
            <li>Genre: Fantasy, supernatural, romance.</li>
            <li> What it's about: Gong Yoo portrays Kim Shin, a fierce Goryeo dynasty general who has led his men through many successful battles.
                <br>When he's killed, he's cursed to live forever as a goblin who can only die once the love of his life removes the invisible sword lodged in his chest.</br><br>Ji Eun-tak (Kim Go-eun) is a clairvoyant high school student who is immune to the goblin’s powers and may just be the girl he’s been dreaming of for the last 939 years.</br>
                Add in a grim reaper (Lee Dong-wook) for a roommate, a bubbly chicken shop owner (Yoo In-na), and a ~mythical~ soundtrack, and it’s easy to see why Guardian was one of the most popular dramas of 2016!</li>
            <li> Where to watch: Viki</li>
